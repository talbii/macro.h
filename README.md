# macro.h - C99 (mostly) Conforming Macros

`macro.h` is a simple project which contains many macros useful in many different scenarios. The macros are designed to be as dependency-free as possible, and as backwards compatible as possible.

- To include **all** of the macros (note: there are a lot of macros and you will probably experience a lot of global names taken), include `macro.h`.

- Otherwise, search for the macros needed and include those files instead.
